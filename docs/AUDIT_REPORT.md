# Documentation Audit Report

## Issues Found

### 1. Navigation Links in docs/04-guidelines.md
**Issue**: The "Next" link points to `05‑Phase‑01‑Scaffolding.md` which doesn't exist anymore.
**Should be**: `Phase-01-Scaffolding.md`

### 2. Missing Cross-References in Phase Documents
**Issue**: Phase documents don't reference the requirements docs they should follow
**Should have**: Each phase should reference relevant sections from:
- `02-requirements.md` for functional requirements
- `03-obs_api.md` for OBS constraints
- `04-guidelines.md` for coding style

### 3. Incorrect Sync Interval in Phase 03
**Issue**: Phase 03 mentions "every 30 minutes" but `02-requirements.md` doesn't specify this
**Should**: Either update requirements or change phase to match

### 4. Missing Testing Sections
**Issue**: Most phases don't have "Testing Before Commit" sections
**Should**: All phases should include testing steps like Phase 02 now has

### 5. Phase File References
**Issue**: Phases reference "Phase XX" in navigation but don't use consistent format
**Should**: Use exact filenames for clarity

### 6. Missing Workflow Information
**Issue**: Only Phase 02 has testing section after our update
**Should**: All phases need testing sections

## Recommendations

1. Update all navigation links to use correct filenames
2. Add requirement references to each phase
3. Add testing sections to all phases
4. Ensure consistency between requirements and phase implementations
5. Add a main README in phases folder explaining the workflow
