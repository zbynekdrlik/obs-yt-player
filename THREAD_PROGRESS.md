## Migration Cleanup Complete! ✅

### What Was Just Done
1. **Fixed critical __init__.py** - Restored proper imports so the package works correctly
2. **Removed all duplicate files** from root ytfast_modules/:
   - __init__.py
   - config.py
   - logger.py
   - state.py
   - tools.py
   - utils.py
3. **Verified clean structure** - No more duplicates or messy files
