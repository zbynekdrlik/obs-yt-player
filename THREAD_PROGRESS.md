# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Created helper script for setting up new instances
- [x] Created migration script for existing users
- [x] Updated documentation with folder-based approach
- [x] Created PR #29 for review
- [x] Removed ytfast.py from root (now in yt-player-main/)
- [x] Started migrating modules (6/21 completed)
- [ ] Currently working on: Module migration via API (slow process)
- [ ] Waiting for: User decision on completion approach
- [ ] Blocked by: API rate limits make individual file operations slow

## Migration Progress

### Files Successfully Moved to yt-player-main/ytfast_modules/
1. ✅ __init__.py
2. ✅ config.py
3. ✅ logger.py  
4. ✅ state.py
5. ✅ tools.py
6. ✅ utils.py

### Files Still Needed (15 remaining)
- cache.py
- download.py
- gemini_metadata.py
- media_control.py
- metadata.py
- normalize.py
- opacity_control.py
- playback.py
- playback_controller.py
- playlist.py
- reprocess.py
- scene.py
- state_handlers.py
- title_manager.py
- video_selector.py

## Current State Assessment

The branch is now **minimally testable** with the core startup files in place. However, it won't be fully functional until all modules are migrated.

### Options to Complete Migration

1. **Continue via API** (Current approach)
   - Estimated time: 30-45 minutes for remaining 15 files
   - One file at a time due to API constraints
   - Safe but tedious

2. **Local Clone & Push** (Recommended)
   ```bash
   git clone -b feature/folder-based-instances https://github.com/zbynekdrlik/obs-yt-player.git
   cd obs-yt-player
   # Move remaining files
   for file in cache.py download.py gemini_metadata.py media_control.py metadata.py normalize.py opacity_control.py playback.py playback_controller.py playlist.py reprocess.py scene.py state_handlers.py title_manager.py video_selector.py; do
     mv ytfast_modules/$file yt-player-main/ytfast_modules/
   done
   # Remove old directory
   rmdir ytfast_modules
   # Commit and push
   git add .
   git commit -m "Complete module migration to folder structure"
   git push
   ```

3. **Bulk Copy Operation** (If we can optimize API usage)
   - Need to fetch all file contents first
   - Then push all at once
   - More complex but faster than one-by-one

## Implementation Status
- Phase: Folder-Based Multi-Instance Support
- Status: PARTIAL MIGRATION IN PROGRESS
- Branch: feature/folder-based-instances

## Architecture Decision

The folder-based approach is proven to work. We're now in the process of physically moving files to match the new structure. The migration approach taken (full migration in repository) ensures new users get the correct structure by default.

## Next Steps

**Immediate Decision Needed:**
1. Continue copying files one by one via API (I can continue)
2. User completes migration locally using git commands above
3. Explore bulk copy approach

**After Migration Complete:**
1. Delete old ytfast_modules/ directory from root
2. Test the complete structure
3. Update PR for final review
4. Merge when ready

## Success Metrics

- [x] Folder structure created
- [x] Main script moved
- [x] Core modules started migration
- [ ] All modules migrated (6/21 done)
- [ ] Old structure removed
- [ ] Full testing complete

**Version**: Will be v4.0.0 when merged (major architecture change)
