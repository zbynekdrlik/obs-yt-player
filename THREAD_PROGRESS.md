# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**‚ö†Ô∏è EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Fixed scene.py - restored to match main branch functionality with only import changes
- [x] Version bumped to 4.0.6
- [ ] Currently working on: Deep comparison of remaining modules
- [ ] Waiting for: Testing to verify scene functionality is restored
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## üîß Fixes Applied in v4.0.6
1. **scene.py** - Completely restored to match main branch:
   - Brought back nested scene detection
   - Restored transition awareness
   - Restored Studio Mode support
   - Removed scene creation functionality that doesn't exist in main
   - Kept only import changes (absolute ‚Üí relative)

## üìã Files Verified as Correct
These files match main branch with only import changes:
- ‚úÖ `state.py` - Identical except imports
- ‚úÖ `logger.py` - Identical except imports
- ‚úÖ `utils.py` - Already fixed syntax error in v4.0.5
- ‚úÖ `gemini_metadata.py` - Already using urllib (standard library)
- ‚úÖ `playback.py` - Only import changes
- ‚úÖ `config.py` - Has necessary changes for multi-instance (dynamic script detection)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Files Still Need Checking
Need to compare these with main branch:
- [ ] `cache.py`
- [ ] `download.py`
- [ ] `media_control.py`
- [ ] `metadata.py`
- [ ] `normalize.py`
- [ ] `opacity_control.py`
- [ ] `playback_controller.py`
- [ ] `playlist.py`
- [ ] `reprocess.py`
- [ ] `state_handlers.py`
- [ ] `title_manager.py`
- [ ] `tools.py`
- [ ] `video_selector.py`

## üéØ NEXT STEPS
1. Continue deep comparison with main branch
2. Revert any functionality changes in remaining modules
3. Test that scene detection/transitions work correctly
4. Verify functionality matches main branch exactly
5. Test multi-instance isolation

## Version History
- **v4.0.1-4.0.4**: Multiple attempts with various issues
- **v4.0.5**: Fixed import errors but functionality changes remained
- **v4.0.6**: Restored scene.py to match main branch

## Current Status
- Branch: `feature/folder-based-instances`
- PR: #29
- State: Fixing functionality regressions
- Next Step: Continue module comparison and testing

## Success Criteria
- Script loads in OBS ‚úÖ
- Functionality IDENTICAL to main branch ‚è≥ (in progress)
- Only difference is folder structure and imports ‚è≥ (in progress)
- Multiple instances can run independently (not tested yet)

## Key Learning
**MINIMAL CHANGES ONLY**: This feature should only change:
1. Import system (absolute ‚Üí relative)
2. Dynamic script name detection
3. Module directory naming
4. Default cache location (inside instance folder)

Everything else should remain UNCHANGED from main branch.
