# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Created ytplay.py (copy of ytfast.py) 
- [x] Created rename_to_ytplay.py migration script
- [ ] **WAITING FOR USER**: Run the migration script locally to complete rename
- [ ] After migration: Delete ytfast.py from GitHub
- [ ] After migration: Test everything works

## Migration Script Ready
I've created `rename_to_ytplay.py` that will:
1. Rename `ytfast.py` → `ytplay.py` (or remove old one)
2. Rename `ytfast_modules/` → `ytplay_modules/`
3. Update all imports throughout codebase
4. Update documentation references
5. Update setup_new_instance.py

## How to Complete the Rename
```bash
# 1. Pull the latest changes
git pull origin feature/folder-based-instances

# 2. Run the migration script
python rename_to_ytplay.py

# 3. Test in OBS that everything works

# 4. Commit the changes
git add -A
git commit -m "Complete ytfast to ytplay rename"
git push origin feature/folder-based-instances
```

## What the Script Will Do
- ✅ Handle all 21 module files automatically
- ✅ Update all imports and references
- ✅ Update documentation
- ✅ Preserve all functionality
- ✅ Clean up old files

## Version for Release
**v4.0.0** - Major changes:
- Folder-based multi-instance architecture  
- Renamed from ytfast to ytplay

## Testing After Migration

- [ ] Video playback works
- [ ] Playlist sync works
- [ ] All playback modes work
- [ ] Multi-instance setup works

## Critical Information
- Branch: `feature/folder-based-instances`
