# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Created helper script for setting up new instances
- [x] Created migration script for existing users
- [x] Updated documentation with folder-based approach
- [ ] Currently working on: Creating PR for review
- [ ] Waiting for: User testing and feedback
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## Implementation Status
- Phase: Folder-Based Multi-Instance Support
- Status: IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE, READY FOR TESTING

## What We've Done

### Scripts Created
1. **setup_new_instance.py** ✅
   - Automates creating new player instances
   - Handles all renaming and import updates
   - Provides clear success/error messages

2. **migrate_to_folders.py** ✅
   - Helps existing users move to folder structure
   - Preserves all settings and cache
   - Updates .gitignore appropriately

### Documentation Updated
1. **docs/FOLDER_BASED_INSTANCES.md** ✅
   - Comprehensive guide for the new approach
   - Explains benefits over state isolation
   - Includes troubleshooting section

2. **README.md** ✅
   - Added prominent section about folder-based approach
   - Updated installation instructions
   - Maintained all existing content

## Benefits Achieved

### Over Previous Attempts
- **No state isolation complexity** - Each folder is independent
- **No import path conflicts** - Separate module folders
- **No threading issues** - Complete isolation
- **Simple to understand** - Just copy a folder
- **Easy to debug** - Problems stay contained

### User Experience
- Setup new instance: `python setup_new_instance.py main worship`
- Migrate existing: `python migrate_to_folders.py`
- Clear folder organization
- No more failed branches due to regressions

## Next Steps

### For User
1. Review the implementation
2. Test the migration script with existing setup
3. Try creating a new instance with helper script
4. Provide feedback on the approach

### Technical Tasks
- [ ] Create PR for review
- [ ] Test with multiple instances running
- [ ] Verify OBS integration works properly
- [ ] Document any edge cases found

## Why This Approach Works

Unlike the complex state isolation attempts in the failed branches:
- Each instance has its own complete file set
- No shared modules means no conflicts possible
- Python's import system works naturally
- Debugging is straightforward - check one folder

## Migration Path

From failed branches:
1. User can abandon those branches
2. Start fresh from main
3. Use migration script
4. Never deal with state isolation again

## Notes

This approach trades disk space (duplicated modules) for massive simplicity gains. Given modern disk sizes and the small size of the modules (~200KB), this is a worthwhile trade-off.

The helper scripts make the setup process even easier than the original single-file approach while providing complete isolation between instances.
