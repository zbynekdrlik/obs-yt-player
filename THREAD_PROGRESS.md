# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**‚ö†Ô∏è EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Fixed multiple import errors to get script loading in OBS
- [x] Script now loads but has CHANGED FUNCTIONALITY compared to main branch
- [ ] **CRITICAL ISSUE**: Feature branch has modified core functionality that should NOT have been touched
- [ ] **NEXT GOAL**: Deep comparison with main branch to revert ALL functionality changes

## üö® MAJOR PROBLEM IDENTIFIED
This feature branch was supposed to implement ONLY:
- Simple folder-based multi-instance support
- Copy script to new folder with new name
- Each instance runs independently

Instead, the branch has:
- Modified core functionality
- Introduced bugs that don't exist in main
- Changed behavior of existing features
- Made unnecessary "improvements" that broke stable code

## üìã NEXT THREAD GOAL
**DEEP COMPARISON AND REVERSION PLAN**

### Objective:
Compare EVERY module in feature branch against main branch and revert ALL functionality changes except those strictly required for folder-based multi-instance support.

### Allowed Changes:
1. **Import system**: Change from absolute to relative imports (required for isolation)
2. **Dynamic script name detection**: Allow any script name (ytplay.py, ytworship.py, etc.)
3. **Module directory naming**: Support {script_name}_modules pattern
4. **Version bump**: To 4.0.x for this feature

### NOT Allowed (Must Revert):
- ANY changes to core logic
- ANY new features or "improvements"
- ANY behavioral changes
- ANY modifications to existing functionality
- ANY new dependencies or libraries

### Comparison Tasks:
For each module, compare feature branch vs main:
1. `config.py` - Keep ONLY script name detection changes
2. `state.py` - Should be IDENTICAL except imports
3. `logger.py` - Should be IDENTICAL except imports
4. `cache.py` - Should be IDENTICAL except imports
5. `download.py` - Should be IDENTICAL except imports
6. `metadata.py` - Should be IDENTICAL except imports
7. `gemini_metadata.py` - Should be IDENTICAL except imports
8. `scene.py` - Should be IDENTICAL except imports
9. `playback.py` - Should be IDENTICAL except imports
10. All other modules - Should be IDENTICAL except imports

### Process:
1. Use diff tool to compare each file
2. Identify ALL changes beyond imports
3. Revert non-essential changes
4. Test that functionality matches main branch exactly
5. Minimal diff = successful implementation

## Version History (What Went Wrong):
- **v4.0.1-4.0.4**: Multiple attempts with various issues
- **v4.0.5**: Fixed import errors but still has functionality changes
- **Main Issue**: Each iteration added MORE changes instead of keeping it simple

## Success Criteria:
- Script loads in OBS ‚úì (achieved)
- Functionality IDENTICAL to main branch ‚úó (failed)
- Only difference is folder structure and imports ‚úó (failed)
- Multiple instances can run independently (not tested yet)

## Current Status:
- Branch: `feature/folder-based-instances`
- PR: #29
- State: Script loads but has regression in functionality
- Next Step: Deep comparison and reversion to match main branch

## Critical Learning:
**KISS Principle Failed**: This should have been a 50-line change maximum. Instead, it became a major refactor that broke things. The next thread must focus on MINIMAL changes only.
