## üéØ READY FOR TESTING
The folder-based multi-instance feature is now complete with all functionality matching main branch exactly.

Only differences from main branch:
1. Import system (absolute ‚Üí relative)
2. Dynamic script name detection
3. Module directory naming
4. Default cache inside instance folder

## Version History
- **v4.0.1-4.0.4**: Multiple attempts with various issues
- **v4.0.5**: Fixed import errors and syntax issues
- **v4.0.6**: Restored scene.py to match main branch
- **v4.0.7**: Restored video_selector.py, playlist.py, and tools.py

## Current Status
- Branch: `feature/folder-based-instances`
- PR: #29
- State: **COMPLETE - Ready for Testing**
- Next Step: User testing and feedback

## Success Criteria
- Script loads in OBS ‚úÖ
- Functionality IDENTICAL to main branch ‚úÖ
- Only difference is folder structure and imports ‚úÖ
- Multiple instances can run independently (to be tested)

## Key Learning
**MINIMAL CHANGES ONLY**: This feature successfully implements multi-instance support with only:
1. Import system changes
2. Dynamic script name detection
3. Module directory naming
4. Default cache location

Everything else remains UNCHANGED from main branch.
