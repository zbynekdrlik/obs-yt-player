## üéâ READY FOR MERGE
All implementation, testing, and documentation complete!

## üìã Merge Preparation Checklist
- ‚úÖ Code implementation complete and tested
- ‚úÖ Batch file tested and working correctly
- ‚úÖ All documentation updated:
  - ‚úÖ README.md - Added multi-instance section
  - ‚úÖ DOCUMENTATION_STRUCTURE.md - Updated for v4.0.7
  - ‚úÖ docs/FOLDER_BASED_INSTANCES.md - Comprehensive guide
  - ‚úÖ MERGE_SUMMARY.md - Created for PR reference
- ‚úÖ Version set to 4.0.7 in config.py
- ‚úÖ PR description up to date
- ‚úÖ All tests passing

## üéâ SUCCESS: v4.0.7 WORKING
User confirmed that v4.0.7 is working correctly!

## ‚úÖ Deep Analysis Complete
Performed comprehensive comparison between main and feature branches:
- All 20 modules have identical functionality
- Only changes are import pattern (absolute ‚Üí relative)
- Dynamic script detection implemented correctly
- Multi-instance support confirmed working

## üîß Fixed: Batch File Issues
1. **Validation issue fixed:**
   - Problem: `echo %INSTANCE_NAME% |` was adding trailing space
   - Solution: Removed space before pipe character: `echo %INSTANCE_NAME%|`

2. **Naming issue fixed:**
   - Problem: Was prefixing "yt" to names (ytytfast.py instead of ytfast.py)
   - Solution: Use instance name directly without prefix
   
3. **Removed unnecessary import updates:**
   - The dynamic import system makes manual updates unnecessary
   - All imports are relative and work automatically

## ‚úÖ All Modules Verified and Working
All 20 modules have been compared with main branch and are now identical except for imports:
- ‚úÖ `cache.py` - Identical except imports
- ‚úÖ `config.py` - Has necessary changes for multi-instance
- ‚úÖ `download.py` - Identical except imports
- ‚úÖ `gemini_metadata.py` - Already using urllib
- ‚úÖ `logger.py` - Identical except imports
- ‚úÖ `media_control.py` - Identical except imports
- ‚úÖ `metadata.py` - Identical except imports
- ‚úÖ `normalize.py` - Identical except imports
- ‚úÖ `opacity_control.py` - Identical except imports
- ‚úÖ `playback.py` - Only import changes
- ‚úÖ `playback_controller.py` - Identical except imports
- ‚úÖ `playlist.py` - Restored in v4.0.7
- ‚úÖ `reprocess.py` - Identical except imports
- ‚úÖ `scene.py` - Restored in v4.0.6
- ‚úÖ `state.py` - Identical except imports
- ‚úÖ `state_handlers.py` - Identical except imports
- ‚úÖ `title_manager.py` - Identical except imports
- ‚úÖ `tools.py` - Restored in v4.0.7
- ‚úÖ `utils.py` - Fixed syntax error in v4.0.5
- ‚úÖ `video_selector.py` - Restored in v4.0.7

## Version History
- **v4.0.1-4.0.4**: Multiple attempts with various issues
- **v4.0.5**: Fixed import errors and syntax issues
- **v4.0.6**: Restored scene.py to match main branch
- **v4.0.7**: Restored video_selector.py, playlist.py, and tools.py - **CONFIRMED WORKING**

## Current Status
- Branch: `feature/folder-based-instances`
- PR: #29
- State: **READY FOR MERGE**
- Next Step: Merge to main branch

## Key Achievement
Successfully implemented folder-based multi-instance support with minimal changes:
1. Import system changes (absolute ‚Üí relative)
2. Dynamic script name detection
3. Module directory naming
4. Default cache location
5. Instance creation script (now simplified and corrected)

**Everything else remains UNCHANGED from main branch - and it's WORKING!**

## What Happens After Merge
1. Users can create multiple instances with `create_new_ytplayer.bat`
2. Each instance is completely isolated
3. Breaking change: Script renamed from ytfast to ytplay
4. Users need to update their OBS script references
5. Existing caches can be moved to new structure
