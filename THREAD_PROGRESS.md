# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**‚ö†Ô∏è EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Fixed import error "attempted relative import with no known parent package" (v4.0.5)
- [x] Fixed syntax error in utils.py - restored double backslash for proper string literal
- [x] Fixed gemini_metadata.py - removed external library dependency (google.generativeai)
- [x] Changed main script to use dynamic package imports with importlib
- [ ] **READY FOR TESTING** - All import and dependency issues resolved

## Summary of Changes:

### üéØ Core Architecture
1. **Dynamic Script Detection**: config.py now automatically detects script name
2. **Flexible Naming**: Any script name works (ytplay.py, ytworship.py, remixes.py)
3. **Scene = Script Name**: Automatic scene naming from script filename
4. **FIXED**: Import system redesigned - uses importlib for dynamic package imports (v4.0.5)

### üîß Helper Scripts (Simplified)
1. **create_new_ytplayer.bat**: Windows batch file for easy instance creation
2. Removed Python scripts and cleanup batch file (no longer needed)

### üìö Documentation Updates
1. **README.md**: Fixed media source name, removed Python script references
2. **FOLDER_BASED_INSTANCES.md**: Updated for batch-only approach
3. Clear instructions for Windows users

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Benefits
- **Complete Isolation**: Each instance in its own folder
- **No State Conflicts**: Impossible to have cross-contamination
- **Easy Setup**: `create_new_ytplayer.bat worship` creates everything
- **Flexible Naming**: No restrictions on script names
- **True Multi-Instance**: Fixed import system to use dynamic package loading (v4.0.5)

## Bug Fixes:
- **v4.0.2**: Claims to fix hardcoded imports (but didn't actually fix them)
- **v4.0.3**: Claims to fix critical missed import in playback.py (but didn't actually fix them)
- **v4.0.4**: ACTUALLY fixed ALL imports to use relative imports in all modules
- **v4.0.5**: Fixed "attempted relative import with no known parent package" error by redesigning import system
- **Syntax Fix**: Fixed string literal syntax error in utils.py (corrupted during conversion)
- **Dependency Fix**: Removed accidental google.generativeai dependency in gemini_metadata.py

## Import System Redesign (v4.0.5):
The main script now:
1. Uses `importlib.import_module()` to dynamically import the module package
2. Imports modules as `modules.config`, `modules.logger`, etc.
3. Each instance has its own module namespace
4. Properly supports relative imports within modules
5. No more direct imports that break the package structure

## Additional Fixes:
- **utils.py syntax error**: Fixed corrupted string literal on line 33
  - Was: `invalid_chars = '<>:"|?*\'` (unclosed string)
  - Fixed to: `invalid_chars = '<>:"|?*\\'` (proper double backslash)
- **gemini_metadata.py dependency**: Removed google.generativeai import
  - Reverted to use standard library urllib (matching main branch)
  - No external dependencies required

## Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Test main template (ytplay.py) loads without import errors
- [ ] Test create_new_ytplayer.bat creates instance correctly
- [ ] Test that instance works independently
- [ ] Verify scene detection works
- [ ] Confirm media source "video" plays correctly
- [ ] Test multiple instances run simultaneously without conflicts
- [ ] Verify imports are truly isolated between instances

## Version for Release
**v4.0.5** - Major architectural changes:
- Folder-based multi-instance support
- Renamed ytfast ‚Üí ytplay
- Dynamic configuration
- Complete isolation between instances
- Windows batch file support
- Simplified setup process
- Fixed ALL imports to use relative imports for true multi-instance isolation
- Redesigned import system using importlib for proper package loading
- Fixed syntax error introduced during conversion
- Removed external library dependencies

## PR Status:
- Branch: `feature/folder-based-instances`
- PR: #29
- Status: **All issues fixed, ready for testing**
- Changes: Fixed import errors, syntax errors, and removed external dependencies

## Critical Note:
Version 4.0.5 redesigns the import system to properly support multi-instance operation. The main script now uses `importlib` to dynamically import the modules as a proper Python package. Also fixed:
1. Syntax error in utils.py (string literal)
2. External dependency on google.generativeai (reverted to urllib)

The script now uses only standard Python libraries and should load properly in OBS.
