# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: Fixed .gitignore to protect instance folders
- [ ] Waiting for: User to recreate instances and test
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## Implementation Status
- Phase: Source Name Redesign
- Step: Implementation COMPLETE, .gitignore FIXED
- Status: IMPLEMENTED_NOT_TESTED

## Version History
- v4.0.7 → v4.1.0: Implemented unique source names for multi-instance support

## Testing Status Matrix
| Component | Implemented | Unit Tested | Integration Tested | Multi-Instance Tested | 
|-----------|------------|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| config.py | ✅ v4.1.0  | ❌          | ❌                 | ❌                    |
| .gitignore | ✅ Fixed   | ❌          | ❌                 | ❌                    |
| All modules using source names | ✅ | ❌ | ❌           | ❌                    |

## Recent Issue & Fix
**Problem**: Git deleted yt-player-ytfast and yt-player-ytslow folders during pull
**Cause**: Instance folders weren't in .gitignore, so git cleaned them up as untracked
**Solution**: Added `yt-player-*/` to .gitignore to protect instance folders

## Changes Made
1. **config.py**: 
   - Updated version to 4.1.0
   - Changed source naming to use dynamic prefixes:
     - MEDIA_SOURCE_NAME = f"{SCENE_NAME}_video"
     - TEXT_SOURCE_NAME = f"{SCENE_NAME}_title"
   - This ensures unique names like ytplay_video, ytfast_video, etc.

2. **.gitignore**:
   - Added `yt-player-*/` to protect instance folders from git operations

3. **No other files needed changes** because:
   - All modules import source names from config.py
   - The dynamic naming happens automatically

## Last User Action
- Date/Time: Just now
- Action: Reported that pull deleted instance folders
- Result: Fixed .gitignore to prevent future deletions
- Next Required: User needs to recreate instances with bat script and test

## Next Steps for User
1. Run create_new_ytplayer.bat to recreate ytfast and ytslow instances
2. Test with single instance first to ensure existing functionality works
3. Update OBS scenes to use new source names:
   - ytplay scene: ytplay_video and ytplay_title
   - ytfast scene: ytfast_video and ytfast_title
   - ytslow scene: ytslow_video and ytslow_title
4. Test that sources don't conflict between scenes
5. Provide logs showing version 4.1.0 loaded

## Important Notes
- This is a BREAKING CHANGE - users need to update their OBS source references
- Old source names (video, title) won't work anymore
- New source names follow pattern: [instance]_video and [instance]_title
- Instance folders are now protected by .gitignore
