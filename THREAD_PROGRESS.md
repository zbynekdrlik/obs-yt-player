## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: Created update_all_instances.bat script
- [ ] Waiting for: User testing and approval
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## Implementation Status

## Feature: Batch Script for Updating All Instances

### What Was Requested:
- A batch script that updates all instances from main
- Uses git to update the repository first
- Updates all existing instances with latest code from template

### What Was Implemented:
1. **update_all_instances.bat** - Version 1.0.0
   - Runs `git pull origin main` to update repository
   - Finds all `yt-player-*` directories
   - Updates each instance from template (`yt-player-main`)
   - Preserves cache and configuration
   - Shows summary of updates/errors
   
2. **Documentation Updates:**
   - Updated README.md with new "Updating All Instances" section
   - Added script to project structure listing
   - Clear instructions on usage

### How It Works:
```cmd
update_all_instances.bat
```

The script will:
1. Update main repository from GitHub
2. Find all instance directories (yt-player-*)
3. Skip the template directory
4. Update each instance's modules and main script
5. Preserve cache and configuration
6. Show summary of what was updated
