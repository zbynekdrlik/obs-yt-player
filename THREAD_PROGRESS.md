# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: Implementing unique source names by prefixing with scene name
- [ ] Waiting for: User testing
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## Implementation Status
- Phase: Source Name Redesign
- Step: Implementation COMPLETE
- Status: IMPLEMENTED_NOT_TESTED

## Version History
- v4.0.7 → v4.1.0: Implemented unique source names for multi-instance support

## Testing Status Matrix
| Component | Implemented | Unit Tested | Integration Tested | Multi-Instance Tested | 
|-----------|------------|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| config.py | ✅ v4.1.0  | ❌          | ❌                 | ❌                    |
| All modules using source names | ✅ | ❌ | ❌           | ❌                    |

## Changes Made
1. **config.py**: 
   - Updated version to 4.1.0
   - Changed source naming to use dynamic prefixes:
     - MEDIA_SOURCE_NAME = f"{SCENE_NAME}_video"
     - TEXT_SOURCE_NAME = f"{SCENE_NAME}_title"
   - This ensures unique names like ytplay_video, ytfast_video, etc.

2. **No other files needed changes** because:
   - All modules import source names from config.py
   - The dynamic naming happens automatically
   - scene.py, media_control.py, title_manager.py, opacity_control.py all use the imported names

## Last User Action
- Date/Time: Just now
- Action: Requested implementation of unique source names
- Result: Implementation complete
- Next Required: User needs to test with multiple instances

## Next Steps for User
1. Test with single instance first to ensure existing functionality works
2. Create multiple instances (ytplay, ytfast, ytslow)
3. Update OBS scenes to use new source names (e.g., ytplay_video instead of video)
4. Test that sources don't conflict between scenes
5. Provide logs showing version 4.1.0 loaded

## Important Notes
- This is a BREAKING CHANGE - users need to update their OBS source references
- Old source names (video, title) won't work anymore
- New source names follow pattern: [instance]_video and [instance]_title
