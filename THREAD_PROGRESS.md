# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] All 21 module files ARE present in yt-player-main/ytfast_modules/
- [x] User partially completed local migration
- [ ] Currently working on: Cleaning up duplicate files and verifying consistency
- [ ] Waiting for: None - taking over to complete cleanup
- [ ] Blocked by: File content differences need resolution

## CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND

### 1. Duplicate Files
- **Root `ytfast_modules/`** still exists with 6 files (should be deleted)
- **All files are in new location** but duplicates remain

### 2. File Content Differences
- `__init__.py`: Different content (548 bytes new vs 1002 bytes old)
- `logger.py`: 1 byte difference (4924 vs 4923)
- Other files may have differences

### 3. Root Directory Cleanup Needed
```
TO DELETE:
- ytfast_modules/ (entire directory from root)
- Any other incorrect files in root
```

## Current File Status

### ✅ Files in CORRECT location (yt-player-main/ytfast_modules/)
All 21 files present:
- __init__.py ⚠️ (different content)
- cache.py ✅
- config.py ✅
- download.py ✅
- gemini_metadata.py ✅
- logger.py ⚠️ (1 byte diff)
- media_control.py ✅
- metadata.py ✅
- normalize.py ✅
- opacity_control.py ✅
- playback.py ✅
- playback_controller.py ✅
- playlist.py ✅
- reprocess.py ✅
- scene.py ✅
- state.py ✅
- state_handlers.py ✅
- title_manager.py ✅
- tools.py ✅
- utils.py ✅
- video_selector.py ✅

### ❌ Files in WRONG location (root ytfast_modules/)
Still present (should be deleted):
- __init__.py
- config.py
- logger.py
- state.py
- tools.py
- utils.py

## Action Plan

### 1. Verify Content Differences
- Check why __init__.py has different content
- Check why logger.py has 1 byte difference
- Ensure we keep the correct versions

### 2. Delete Root ytfast_modules/
- Remove entire directory after verification
- This completes the migration

### 3. Final Verification
- Ensure ytfast.py can import from new location
- Check no other root files need cleanup
- Test basic functionality

## Migration Status
- Phase: Folder-Based Multi-Instance Support
- Status: MIGRATION COMPLETE BUT NEEDS CLEANUP
- Branch: feature/folder-based-instances

## Next Steps for Claude

1. **Compare file contents** to ensure correct versions
2. **Delete root ytfast_modules/** directory
3. **Verify no other cleanup needed**
4. **Update PR** with final status
5. **Request user testing**

## Success Metrics

- [x] All modules present in new location
- [ ] Old location cleaned up
- [ ] No duplicate files
- [ ] File content verified
- [ ] Basic import test passes

**Version**: Will be v4.0.0 when merged (major architecture change)
