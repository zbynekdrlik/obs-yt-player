# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**‚ö†Ô∏è EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Version 4.0.7 CONFIRMED WORKING by user! üéâ
- [x] All modules match main branch functionality
- [ ] Currently working on: Preparing for deep analysis phase
- [ ] Waiting for: New thread for consistency check
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## üéâ SUCCESS: v4.0.7 WORKING
User confirmed that v4.0.7 is working correctly!

## ‚úÖ All Modules Verified and Working
All 20 modules have been compared with main branch and are now identical except for imports:
- ‚úÖ `cache.py` - Identical except imports
- ‚úÖ `config.py` - Has necessary changes for multi-instance
- ‚úÖ `download.py` - Identical except imports
- ‚úÖ `gemini_metadata.py` - Already using urllib
- ‚úÖ `logger.py` - Identical except imports
- ‚úÖ `media_control.py` - Identical except imports
- ‚úÖ `metadata.py` - Identical except imports
- ‚úÖ `normalize.py` - Identical except imports
- ‚úÖ `opacity_control.py` - Identical except imports
- ‚úÖ `playback.py` - Only import changes
- ‚úÖ `playback_controller.py` - Identical except imports

- ‚úÖ `video_selector.py` - Restored in v4.0.7

## üîç NEXT PHASE: Deep Analysis
User has requested a new thread for:
1. **Verify multi-instance changes** in each file
2. **Deep analysis** of code consistency
3. **Thorough check** of implementation

## Version History
- **v4.0.1-4.0.4**: Multiple attempts with various issues
- **v4.0.5**: Fixed import errors and syntax issues
- **v4.0.6**: Restored scene.py to match main branch
- **v4.0.7**: Restored video_selector.py, playlist.py, and tools.py - **CONFIRMED WORKING**

## Current Status
- Branch: `feature/folder-based-instances`
- PR: #29
- State: **WORKING - Ready for Deep Analysis**
- Next Step: New thread for consistency check

## Key Achievement
Successfully implemented folder-based multi-instance support with minimal changes:
1. Import system changes (absolute ‚Üí relative)
2. Dynamic script name detection
3. Module directory naming
4. Default cache location

**Everything else remains UNCHANGED from main branch - and it's WORKING!**
