## Last User Action
- Date/Time: Just now
- Action: Requested implementation of unique source names
- Result: Starting implementation
- Next Required: User testing after implementation

## Context
User discovered that OBS sources must have unique names across all scenes. Current implementation uses "title" and "video" for all instances, which conflicts when running multiple instances (ytplay, ytfast, ytslow).

Solution: Prefix source names with scene name (e.g., ytplay_title, ytplay_video, ytfast_title, ytfast_video)
