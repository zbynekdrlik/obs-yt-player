## Summary of Changes:

### üéØ Core Architecture
1. **Dynamic Script Detection**: config.py now automatically detects script name
2. **Flexible Naming**: Any script name works (ytplay.py, ytworship.py, remixes.py)
3. **Scene = Script Name**: Automatic scene naming from script filename
4. **FIXED**: ALL imports now use relative paths for true multi-instance support

### üîß Helper Scripts (Simplified)
1. **create_new_ytplayer.bat**: Windows batch file for easy instance creation
2. Removed Python scripts and cleanup batch file (no longer needed)

### üìö Documentation Updates
1. **README.md**: Fixed media source name, removed Python script references
2. **FOLDER_BASED_INSTANCES.md**: Updated for batch-only approach
3. Clear instructions for Windows users

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Benefits
- **Complete Isolation**: Each instance in its own folder
- **No State Conflicts**: Impossible to have cross-contamination
- **Easy Setup**: `create_new_ytplayer.bat worship` creates everything
- **Flexible Naming**: No restrictions on script names
- **True Multi-Instance**: Fixed ALL hardcoded imports

## Bug Fixes:
- **v4.0.2**: Fixed hardcoded "ytplay_modules" imports in three modules
- **v4.0.3**: Fixed critical missed import in playback.py
- All imports now use relative paths
- Multi-instance architecture is now fully functional

## Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Test main template (ytplay.py) works
- [ ] Test create_new_ytplayer.bat creates instance correctly
- [ ] Test that instance works independently
- [ ] Verify scene detection works
- [ ] Confirm media source "video" plays correctly
- [ ] Test multiple instances run simultaneously without conflicts
