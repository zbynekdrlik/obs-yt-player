# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Fixed config.py to dynamically detect script name (v4.0.1)
- [x] Created batch file: create_new_ytplayer.bat
- [x] Updated setup_new_instance.py for flexible naming
- [x] Updated README.md (fixed media source name to "video")
- [x] Updated docs/FOLDER_BASED_INSTANCES.md
- [ ] **NEXT**: Need to delete old ytfast_modules directory
- [ ] Test that everything works properly
- [ ] Consider updating version numbers across all files

## Architecture Changes:
### Completed:
- ✅ Dynamic script detection in config.py
- ✅ Batch file for Windows users
- ✅ Flexible setup script that handles any naming pattern
- ✅ Documentation updated to reflect media source = "video"
- ✅ Clear instructions for multi-instance setup

### Key Improvements:
1. **Script name = Scene name** (automatic detection)
2. **Any naming pattern works** (ytplay.py, ytworship.py, remixes.py, etc.)
3. **Simple instance creation**: `create_new_ytplayer.bat worship`
4. **Complete isolation** between instances

## Module Files Status:
### Completed (21/21) - ALL DONE! ✅
All files successfully migrated from ytfast_modules to ytplay_modules with updated imports.

## Next Steps:
1. Delete old ytfast_modules directory (cleanup)
2. Test instance creation with batch file
3. Test that main template works
4. Create example instance and verify functionality
5. Final testing before merge

**v4.0.1** - Major changes with fixes:
- Folder-based multi-instance architecture
