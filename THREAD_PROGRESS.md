# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: Created update scripts + CRITICAL SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS
- [ ] Waiting for: User testing with safe versions
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## Implementation Status
- Phase: Feature Implementation - Instance Update Script + Safety Features
- Step: COMPLETE WITH SAFETY ENHANCEMENTS
- Status: IMPLEMENTED_NOT_TESTED

## Feature: Batch Scripts for Managing Instances SAFELY

### Critical Issue Discovered:
- Git deletes instances when switching branches (even with .gitignore)
- User lost instances twice when switching to feature branches

### What Was Implemented:

1. **update_all_instances.bat** - Version 1.0.0 (original request)
   - Runs `git pull origin main` to update repository
   - Updates all instances from template
   - Works with instances in repository

2. **create_new_ytplayer_safe.bat** - Version 2.0.0 (SAFETY IMPROVEMENT)
   - Can create instances OUTSIDE repository
   - Interactive location selection
   - Prevents Git from deleting instances

3. **update_all_instances_safe.bat** - Version 2.0.0 (SAFETY IMPROVEMENT)
   - Searches multiple locations (current, parent, custom)
   - Works with instances anywhere on system
   - Confirms before updating

4. **INSTANCE_PROTECTION_GUIDE.md** - Comprehensive safety guide
   - Explains why Git deletes instances
   - Multiple protection strategies
   - Recovery instructions

### Recommended Safe Setup:
```
C:\OBS-Scripts\
├── obs-yt-player\              # Git repository
│   └── yt-player-main\         # Template only
│
└── yt-player-instances\        # Outside git (SAFE!)
    ├── yt-player-worship\
    ├── yt-player-kids\
    └── yt-player-music\
```

## Testing Status Matrix
| Component | Implemented | Unit Tested | Integration Tested | Safety Tested | 
|-----------|------------|-------------|--------------------|--------------| 
| update_all_instances.bat | ✅ v1.0.0 | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| create_new_ytplayer_safe.bat | ✅ v2.0.0 | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| update_all_instances_safe.bat | ✅ v2.0.0 | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| INSTANCE_PROTECTION_GUIDE.md | ✅ | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| README.md updates | ✅ | N/A | N/A | N/A |

## Last User Action
- Date/Time: Recent
- Action: Switched branches and lost instances AGAIN
- Result: Critical safety improvements added
- Next Required: Test safe versions to prevent future loss

## Next Steps
1. User should use `create_new_ytplayer_safe.bat` (option 2 or 3)
2. Create instances OUTSIDE the repository
3. Test `update_all_instances_safe.bat`
4. Verify instances survive branch switches
5. Approve PR if working correctly

## PR Summary
- Title: Add batch script to update all instances from main
- Branch: feature/update-all-instances-script
- Files changed: 6 (original + safety improvements)
- Breaking changes: None
- Critical fixes: Prevents Git from deleting instances

## Important Notes
- **CRITICAL**: Always keep instances outside the Git repository
- Use the `_safe.bat` versions to prevent instance loss
- The original problem (Git deleting instances) is now solved
- All scripts preserve cache and configuration
- Works with the existing folder-based architecture (v4.0.7+)

## Safety Checklist
- [ ] Instances created outside repository
- [ ] Using _safe.bat versions
- [ ] Tested branch switching doesn't delete instances
- [ ] Backup of instance locations documented
