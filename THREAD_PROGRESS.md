# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: Scripts consolidated - safety features merged into main scripts
- [ ] Waiting for: User testing with consolidated scripts
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## Implementation Status
- Phase: Feature Implementation - Instance Update Script with Safety
- Step: COMPLETE - Scripts Consolidated
- Status: IMPLEMENTED_NOT_TESTED

## Feature: Batch Scripts for Managing Instances (v2.0.0)

### What Was Implemented:

1. **create_new_ytplayer.bat** - Version 2.0.0
   - Interactive location choice (repo/parent/custom)
   - Can create instances outside repository for safety
   - Creates INSTANCE_INFO.txt for tracking
   - Complete validation and error handling

2. **update_all_instances.bat** - Version 2.0.0
   - Runs `git pull origin main` to update repository
   - Searches current directory, parent directory, custom locations
   - Interactive search for additional locations
   - Updates all instances while preserving cache/config
   - Shows detailed progress and summary

3. **INSTANCE_PROTECTION_GUIDE.md**
   - Comprehensive guide to prevent Git from deleting instances
   - Multiple protection strategies
   - Recovery instructions
   - Best practices

### Script Consolidation:
Per user request, the safe versions were merged into the main scripts:
- Removed create_new_ytplayer_safe.bat
- Removed update_all_instances_safe.bat
- Both main scripts now have all safety features built-in

### Recommended Safe Setup:
```
C:\OBS-Scripts\
├── obs-yt-player\              # Git repository
│   └── yt-player-main\         # Template only
│
└── yt-player-instances\        # Outside git (SAFE!)
    ├── yt-player-worship\
    ├── yt-player-kids\
    └── yt-player-music\
```

## Testing Status Matrix
| Component | Implemented | Unit Tested | Integration Tested | Safety Tested | 
|-----------|------------|-------------|--------------------|--------------| 
| create_new_ytplayer.bat | ✅ v2.0.0 | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| update_all_instances.bat | ✅ v2.0.0 | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| INSTANCE_PROTECTION_GUIDE.md | ✅ | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| README.md updates | ✅ | N/A | N/A | N/A |

## Last User Action
- Date/Time: Recent
- Action: Requested consolidation of scripts (remove safe versions)
- Result: Scripts consolidated with all safety features in main versions
- Next Required: Test consolidated scripts

## Next Steps
1. User should test `create_new_ytplayer.bat` (choose option 2 or 3 for safety)
2. Create instances OUTSIDE the repository
3. Test `update_all_instances.bat`
4. Verify instances survive branch switches
5. Approve PR if working correctly

## PR Summary
- Title: Add batch script to update all instances from main
- Branch: feature/update-all-instances-script
- Files changed: 5 files (after consolidation)
- Breaking changes: None
- Critical improvements: Prevents Git from deleting instances

## Important Notes
- **CRITICAL**: Always keep instances outside the Git repository
- Both scripts now have safety features built-in (v2.0.0)
- The Git deletion issue is solved by keeping instances outside repo
- All scripts preserve cache and configuration
- Works with the existing folder-based architecture (v4.0.7+)

## Safety Checklist
- [ ] Instances created outside repository (option 2 or 3)
- [ ] Using v2.0.0 scripts with safety features
- [ ] Tested branch switching doesn't delete instances
- [ ] Backup of instance locations documented
