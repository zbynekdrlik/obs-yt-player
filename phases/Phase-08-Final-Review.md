# Phase 08 – Final Review & Polish

## Goal
Review the entire `ytfast.py` codebase for:

- Thread safety (locks, queues)
- Error handling and logging consistency
- Compliance with all points in **02-Requirements.md**, **03-OBS_API.md**, **04-Guidelines.md**
- OBS script description length (≤ 400 chars)
- PEP-8 style and useful code comments
- **Verify serial processing pipeline works correctly**

## Review Checklist

### Requirements Compliance
1. All requirements from `02-requirements.md` implemented
2. Serial processing enforced (one video at a time)
3. Metadata extraction working (AcoustID + fallback)
4. Audio normalized to -14 LUFS
5. Proper filename format with sanitization
6. No periodic sync (only startup and manual)

### Technical Review
1. All OBS constraints from `03-obs_api.md` followed
2. Code style matches `04-guidelines.md`
3. Thread safety verified for all shared state
4. No blocking operations on main thread
5. Proper resource cleanup on exit
6. All subprocess calls hidden on Windows

### Quality Checks
1. Error handling comprehensive and graceful
2. Logging appropriate and consistent
3. No debug logging spam
4. Memory usage reasonable
5. CPU usage appropriate
6. Network usage shows serial pattern

## Final Testing
1. Full end-to-end test with real playlist
2. Verify serial processing - monitor network/CPU usage graphs
3. Test all error scenarios:
   - Invalid playlist URL
   - Network interruptions
   - Corrupt video files
   - Missing OBS sources
4. Verify no memory leaks over extended operation
5. Test on Windows, macOS, and Linux if possible
6. Stress test with large playlists (50+ videos)
7. Test with very slow internet (verify one download at a time)
8. Verify script reload/unload is clean

## Performance Validation
- Only one video downloading at a time
- FFmpeg processes run sequentially
- No accumulated temporary files
- Reasonable memory footprint
- Smooth playback transitions

## Commit
After successful testing and review, commit with message:  
> *"Finalize script: serial processing, comprehensive testing, and polish"*

Ensure final script is well-documented and ready for production use.
