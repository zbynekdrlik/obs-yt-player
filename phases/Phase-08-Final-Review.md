## Goal
Review the entire `ytfast.py` codebase for:

- Thread safety (locks, queues)

- Compliance with all points in **02-Requirements.md**, **03-OBS_API.md**, **04-Guidelines.md**
- OBS script description length (≤ 400 chars)
- PEP-8 style and useful code comments

## Review Checklist
1. All requirements from `02-requirements.md` implemented
2. All OBS constraints from `03-obs_api.md` followed
3. Code style matches `04-guidelines.md`
4. Thread safety verified for all shared state
5. Error handling comprehensive
6. Logging appropriate and consistent
7. No blocking operations on main thread

## Final Testing
1. Full end-to-end test with real playlist
2. Test all error scenarios
3. Verify no memory leaks
4. Check CPU usage is reasonable
5. Test on Windows, macOS, and Linux if possible
6. Stress test with large playlists

## Commit
