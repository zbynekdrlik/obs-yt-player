# Phase 09 – Final Polish

## Goal
Final integration testing, performance optimization, error handling improvements, and documentation verification. Ensure the script is production-ready.

## Version Increment
**This phase is polish/optimization** → Increment PATCH version (e.g., `1.6.0` → `1.6.1`)

## Requirements Reference
This phase ensures all requirements from `02-requirements.md` are properly implemented and working together seamlessly.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Integration Testing
- [ ] Full workflow test: playlist sync → download → metadata → normalize → playback
- [ ] Multi-instance test: Run two renamed scripts simultaneously
- [ ] Long-running test: Leave running for 24+ hours
- [ ] Large playlist test: 100+ videos
- [ ] Network interruption test: Disconnect/reconnect during various operations

### 2. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Memory usage monitoring and optimization
- [ ] Thread cleanup verification
- [ ] File handle management
- [ ] Queue size limits if needed
- [ ] Optimize logging for production use

### 3. Error Handling Review
- [ ] Network timeout handling
- [ ] Corrupt video handling
- [ ] Missing source handling
- [ ] Tool failure recovery
- [ ] Graceful degradation

### 4. User Experience
- [ ] Clear error messages
- [ ] Progress indicators
- [ ] Status updates in UI
- [ ] Smooth transitions
- [ ] Resource cleanup on script unload

### 5. Code Quality
- [ ] Remove debug prints
- [ ] Consistent naming conventions
- [ ] Proper docstrings
- [ ] Remove unused imports
- [ ] PEP-8 compliance

### 6. Documentation
- [ ] Verify README accuracy
- [ ] Check all phase cross-references
- [ ] Update version history
- [ ] Verify default playlist works
- [ ] Test installation instructions

## Final Checklist
- [ ] Update `SCRIPT_VERSION` to final release version
- [ ] All phases implemented and tested
- [ ] No console windows appear (Windows)
- [ ] Proper thread shutdown
- [ ] No memory leaks
- [ ] All temporary files cleaned
- [ ] Works with OBS 64-bit
- [ ] Multi-instance support verified
- [ ] All logging appropriate for production

## Production Testing
1. **Clean Install Test**
   - Fresh OBS installation
   - No existing cache
   - Follow README instructions exactly

2. **Stress Test**
   - 200+ video playlist
   - Run for 48 hours
   - Monitor resource usage

3. **Platform Test**
   - Windows 10/11
   - macOS (if applicable)
   - Linux (if applicable)

4. **Edge Cases**
   - Empty playlist
   - Private/deleted videos
   - No internet connection
   - Corrupted cache files
   - Missing OBS sources

## Known Limitations
Document any known limitations:
- API rate limits
- Platform-specific issues
- Performance considerations
- Network requirements

## Commit
After all testing passes, commit with message:  
> *"Final polish and production readiness"*

## Release Preparation
1. Update version to release candidate (e.g., `2.0.0-rc1`)
2. Create comprehensive test report
3. Update README with any final notes
4. Tag release in git
5. Create release notes

*Project complete!*
