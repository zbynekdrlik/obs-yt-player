# Phase Cleanup Summary

## Current Status

We've successfully reorganized the phases with clean naming (Phase-01 through Phase-08), but there are still old files that need to be deleted.

### Clean Structure (Keep these):
- `phases/Phase-01-Scaffolding.md` ✓
- `phases/Phase-02-Dependency-Setup.md` ✓ (NEW)
- `phases/Phase-03-Playlist-Sync.md` ✓
- `phases/Phase-04-Caching.md` ✓
- `phases/Phase-05-Audio-Normalization.md` ✓
- `phases/Phase-06-Playback-Control.md` ✓
- `phases/Phase-07-Metadata.md` ✓
- `phases/Phase-08-Final-Review.md` ✓

### Old Files to Delete:
The following files have the old naming convention and should be deleted:
- All files starting with numbers (05-, 06-, 07-, etc.)
- Empty placeholder files

### Phase Order:
1. **Phase 01**: Scaffolding & Project Skeleton
2. **Phase 02**: Dependency Setup & Tool Management (NEW - downloads yt-dlp and FFmpeg)
3. **Phase 03**: Playlist Sync Thread
4. **Phase 04**: Caching & File Management
5. **Phase 05**: Audio Normalization Thread
6. **Phase 06**: Playback Control & Scene Integration
7. **Phase 07**: Metadata Retrieval
8. **Phase 08**: Final Review & Polish

The cleanup script (`cleanup_phases.py`) can be deleted after the old files are removed.
