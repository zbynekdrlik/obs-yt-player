# Repository Restructuring Summary

## Completed Tasks ✅

### 1. Created New Phase Structure
- ✅ Phase-04-Video-Download.md (NEW)
- ✅ Phase-05-Metadata-Extraction.md (NEW)
- ✅ Phase-06-Audio-Normalization.md (NEW)
- ✅ Phase-07-Playback-Control.md (NEW)
- ✅ Phase-08-Scene-Management.md (NEW)
- ✅ Phase-09-Final-Polish.md (NEW)

### 2. Updated Documentation
- ✅ README.md - Updated with new phase structure
- ✅ DOCUMENTATION_STRUCTURE.md - Updated with new organization
- ✅ Phase-02-Dependency-Setup.md - Added fpcalc tool

### 3. Added Version Management
- ✅ All new phases include version increment reminders
- ✅ Guidelines updated to emphasize version management

## Old Files to Remove 🗑️

These files contain outdated structure and should be deleted:
1. `phases/Phase-04-Serial-Processing.md` (replaced by new Phase 4, 5, 6)
2. `phases/Phase-05-Audio-Normalization.md` (old version, now Phase 6)
3. `phases/Phase-06-Playback-Control.md` (old version, now Phase 7)
4. `phases/Phase-07-Stop-Playback.md` (merged into Phase 8)
5. `phases/Phase-08-Final-Review.md` (replaced by Phase 9)
6. `phases/Phase-09-AcoustID-Metadata.md` (merged into Phase 5)

## Key Improvements Made 🔧

1. **Logical Separation**: Each phase now has a single, clear responsibility
2. **Better Flow**: Download → Metadata → Normalize → Playback → Scene Management
3. **AcoustID Integration**: Now properly placed in Phase 5 (before normalization)
4. **Version Management**: Each phase clearly indicates version increment type
5. **Testing Checklists**: Each phase has comprehensive testing requirements
6. **Cross-References**: All documentation properly linked

## Implementation Status 📊

Currently implemented in ytfast.py:
- ✅ Phase 1: Scaffolding
- ✅ Phase 2: Tool Management (without fpcalc)
- ✅ Phase 3: Playlist Sync
- ✅ Phase 4: Video Download (as part of old Phase 4)
- ❌ Phase 5: Metadata Extraction (partial - no AcoustID)
- ❌ Phase 6: Audio Normalization (placeholder only)
- ❌ Phase 7: Playback Control
- ❌ Phase 8: Scene Management
- ❌ Phase 9: Final Polish

## Next Steps 📝

1. **Delete old phase files** listed above
2. **Update ytfast.py** to match new phase structure:
   - Split current Phase 4 implementation
   - Add fpcalc to Phase 2
   - Implement AcoustID in Phase 5
   - Implement actual normalization in Phase 6
3. **Test** each phase independently
4. **Update version** with each implementation

## Benefits of New Structure ✨

1. **Modularity**: Each phase can be tested independently
2. **Clarity**: Clear what each phase accomplishes
3. **Flexibility**: Easy to skip phases (e.g., AcoustID) if needed
4. **Maintainability**: Easier to debug and update specific features
5. **Documentation**: Better alignment between docs and implementation
