## Development Process

This project follows a structured phase-based development approach. Each phase builds upon the previous one:

### Phase Overview

1. **Phase 01**: Scaffolding & Project Skeleton
2. **Phase 02**: Playlist Synchronisation  
3. **Phase 03**: Video Download & Caching
4. **Phase 04**: Audio Normalisation
5. **Phase 05**: Playback Control & Scene Logic
6. **Phase 06**: Metadata Retrieval
7. **Phase 07**: Final Review & Polish

### Getting Started

1. Read through the documentation in the `docs/` directory:
